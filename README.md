Client exercise summary
---------------------------

###My experience
I worked on windows using PowerShell and WebStorm IDE.
I started by following the codelab on the yeoman site. Everything was simple and well documented. 
The greatest challenge for me, being  unfamiliar with MVC architectural pattern, was understanding and using Angular.

###Yeoman
A yeoman was a member of a social class in medieval England... 
But seriously, yeoman is a tool for creating a web application skeleton very easily and quickly, while also implementing best practices for your app.
Yo Angular (the tool used for this exercise) automatically generates a skeleton for your AngularJS app that is integrated with Bower and grunt tools and provides you with everything you need to create your app.

###Bower
Bower, like npm, is a package manager for client side applications.  
Bower can be used to find, download  and handle dependencies for packages of varied types. 

###Grunt
Grunt is a very powerfull and versatile task running tool. In this exercise we use it to create a local, Node-based web server (grunt serve), running tests (grunt test), and finally running a bunch of tasks defined in Gruntfile.js file that yeoman generated for us  to create a version of the app that is production ready (grunt).

###Firebase
Firebase provides a backend for your app without you having to write or host one yourself.
It provides all your DataBase needs.
